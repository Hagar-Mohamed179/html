        <p><b><strong>HOW TO MAKE MACARONS ?..</strong></b></p>
        <p> <br> First..<b>Sieve</b> the icing sugar and the ground almonds together in a large bowl and whisk together. 
           <br>Second.. <b>Whiz</b> the dry ingredients in the food processor and then sieve again. Repeat this process two more times. Seems like a lot but this is how you get a nice smooth top.
            <br>Third..<b>Whip</b> the egg whites with the cream or tartar. <b>Add</b>salt and gradually add the sugar.<b> Mix</b> until the merengue reaches the soft peak stage. <b>Add</b> vanilla and any gel food coloring in at this point.
            <br>Fourth..The meringue needs to be whipped to <b>STIFF</b> peaks so it is actually best to finish the whisking off by hand. This way you will have a better feel for then the meringue is done.
            <br> Fifth..  <b>Add</b> a third of the confectioner sugar and almond mixture and fold in gently. <b>Move</b> the spatula in circular motions bringing material from underneath to the top. <b>Add</b> the remaining dry mixture and continue folding. 
            <br>sixth..  You will know it is ready when it has a <strong>lava-like</strong> consistency.
            <br>Seventh..<b>Transfer </b>batter to a pastry bag fitted with a round tip.When you are finishing the piping motion stop squeezing the bag and pull up with a circular motion.
            <br>Eighth..<b>Tap</b> the tray several times to remove air bubbles.
            <br> <b>Bake</b> at 300F for 12-15 minutes, rotate tray after 7 minutes. Allow to cool completely before removing from baking sheet.
